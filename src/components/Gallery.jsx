It can move by itself or be controlled from far away, It has a camera to show what's happening around it and can check if the air or water in that area is dirty or dangerous. This robot helps in finding problems like blockagesm bad smells, or harmful gases, without sending any person inside. It's useful fir keeping cities clean and safe.",

When the user says “green light,” the multi-color LED glows green; when “red light” is spoken, it switches to red. This voice-responsive control system demonstrates basic natural language interaction with embedded electronics and highlights the potential of speech-based automation in signaling and accessibility-focused applications.",

The system detects sudden braking conditions and intelligently regulates braking force through servo actuation, minimizing the risk of wheel lock-up or skidding. This project simulates core concepts of Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) in real-world vehicles and showcases how embedded systems can improve control and safety in braking mechanisms.",
